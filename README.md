# Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game where, at a signal, players make figures with their hands, representing a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors.
# One player is controlled by the computer and the other player controlled by you - the user (i.e CPU vs Player). 
# You should make use of the inbuilt Python module random and its choice method.
# Create a new Python file and call it main.py. Inside it you'll create your game.
# "R" for "rock", "P" for "paper", "S" for "scissors".
# When the program is run, ask the user to pick an option between "R", "P" or "S"
# If user input is invalid (not amongst our options), print an error, and ask for their input again (should be a loop)
# If there is a winner, print the winner, and the program ends.
# If it's a tie (the computer and player pick the same move)
